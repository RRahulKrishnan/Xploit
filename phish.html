            <h2>Objective:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify the phishing attempt</strong>: <i>Use your skills to detect the signs that make the email suspicious.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Extract the flag</strong>: The phishing websiteâ€™s HTML source code holds the key.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h2>Skills Required:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing Detection</strong>: Recognize the signs of a phishing email by scrutinizing its details like sender address, language, and the legitimacy of the links.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Security</strong>: Know how to inspect email headers and links for irregularities.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic HTML Knowledge</strong>: Understand how to navigate the HTML source code of a webpage to find hidden content.</li>

            <h2>How to Play:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Multiple Emails</strong>: You will be presented with several emails that look similar. One of them appears legit but contains subtle signs of phishing.</li>
                <li><strong>Search for Clues</strong>: Analyze each email carefully. Look for red flags like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Odd sender email addresses (spoofing)</li>
                        <li>Suspicious language, grammar, or tone</li>
                        <li>Strange or mismatched links (hover over links to see where they actually lead)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Submit Your Findings</strong>: Once you identify the phishing email, submit your answer by extracting the flag hidden in the suspicious link.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <h2>Phishing Red Flags to Watch Out For:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sender Address</strong>: Phishing emails often come from addresses that look legitimate at a glance but contain subtle errors like extra characters or misspellings.</li>
                <li><strong>Urgency and Pressure</strong>: Phishing emails create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly without careful thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Links and Attachments</strong>: Hover over any links in the email to see where they lead. Phishing links often donâ€™t match the displayed text.</li>
                <li><strong>Grammar and Formatting Issues</strong>: Legitimate organizations typically have polished communication. Look out for odd phrasing or errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Requests for Personal Information</strong>: No legitimate organization will ask for sensitive information (passwords, financial details) over email.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
